This is my first repository.
Web design is not so scary after all. It feels powerful being able to change the fate of a layout just with some simple key strokes.  
If I'm not at my computer, I'm either at the gym, in the kitchen or behind a laptop at my local Starbucks with an iced-venti-quad-Latte.
